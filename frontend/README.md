# Development

Aura.ai's frontend uses Next.js for building an interactive user interface. It is advisable to use Docker for working with the frontend instead of using the development server to ensure a successful deployment as Docker build uses `next build` than `next dev` which is responsible for linting and type-checking.

## Pre-requisites

1. [**Node.js:**](https://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime and package management for frontend. Installing Node.js automatically installs `npm`, required for package management.
2. [**Docker:**](https://www.docker.com/) (optional) Supports containerization of frontend for easier deployment.

## Steps

### Manual

1. Ensure you have Node.js and Docker (optional) on your system:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
docker -v
```

2. Install the needed dependencies for the project after cloning the project by the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/arunpranav-at/aura.ai
cd aura.ai/frontend
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. Configure the needed environment variables as per `.env.sample` file

4. Using the development server is acceptable for faster iterations during local development. Start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend should be accessible at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

5. Build for production and test it using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Docker

1. Build a Docker image with the following command after configuring the necessary environment variables (assuming you're using `FAITH/frontend` as the working directory):

```shell
docker build --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=$NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL -t aura-ai-frontend:latest .
```

2. Run the image with the following command:
```shell
docker run --network host aura-ai-frontend:latest 
```

The frontend should be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
